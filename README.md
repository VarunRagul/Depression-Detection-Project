# Depression-Detection-Project
Python project based on natural language processing and machine learning.

The dataset for this particular project can be found at : https://drive.google.com/file/d/1k9JvJxdP81YLQwUhTxvJr9_JuFmfjbKB/view?usp=sharing

Our project aims to detect the signs of depression of a person from their social media postings where they've shared their feelings and emotions. We intend to classify the text provided in the dataset into different labels that indicate the levels of depression by training different deep learning models and comparing them based on results from development and training dataset.

The aim of the project is to predict early signs of depression through Social Media text mining. Below are the steps to execute the code using the datasets uploaded in the repositories:
